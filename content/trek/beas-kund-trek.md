This trek is suitable for all age groups and is a good beginner trek. The Beas Kund trek can be done in long weekend. It starts from Manali and goes into pristinely beautiful Himalayan areas. The trek is along the banks of the Beas River. You wil get good views of the Pir Pinjal ranges. You will pass through the meadows of Dhundi & Bakarthach. The trek takes you to the source of the River Beas, which is a glacial lake.
